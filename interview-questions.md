# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: parameter is a place holder value meant to represent what the value was suppose to be. an argument is a line the software developer writes that contains declarations for values

Researched answer: a parameter is a special type of variable meant to data meant to be inputted. An argument is not a stand in for values like a parameter is , it's a value or values that the developer wants to declare.

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: they take array elements of various data types which are string, boolean, and numbers.

Researched answer: the built in map methods for javascript needs one parameter type to function while taking two kinds optionally, currentValue parameter is required while index and arr are optional.

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer:map is a non mutator and gets access to the elements and display it a certain way while filter has built in if function and can be configured to only show certain values in the array if the developer configures it to.

Researched answer:filter method takes each element in the provided array and automatically applies a conditional statement agianst the elements in the array. The filter will react depending on if the statement is true or false like show only certain values. The map method makes a new array from the old one given, and also applying a function to each value, and show the elements in different formats like having the list doubled or halved or changed order without changing the original  array.

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: iteration can either mean looping a function to keep repeating until a condition is met or it means to look through each value and apply some sort of function to it.

Researched answer:iteration in programming is an order of instruction that keeps repeating. They will keep looping until a condition is met or a certain amount of times the loop occurred has happened, or when it iterates through in array. This info was from computer science wiki dot org.

5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

Your answer:a class is a blueprint or template which gives behavior to methods and objects within it, while an object is an instance of the class and inherits traits from the class on how to act.

Researched answer: class is a detailed template for objects and what it will be, and is crucial for object oriented programming. An object is an instance of a class, data from the class can be accessed through objects.

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: making js move the declaration be read as if it moved to the top

Researched answer:avaScript Hoisting is the process where the ide interpreter appears to move the declaration of functions, variables or classes to the top of their code, before launching of the code.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. User stories: prompts that tell the coder what function to add to their code from the user's point of view

2. Spread operator: operators in java script that are used to make copies of objects in js

3. React: java script library that is used to make user interfaces for front end devloping

4. React props: components in java used to communicate data and behaviors between objects and parts

5. DOM events:
